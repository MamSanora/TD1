      <h3>Greeting, dear friend!</h3>
      <p>
        I would like to invite you to speak at our annual developer conference.
        I’m running a YouTube blog about cats, and we’d love to feature your brand in our next video.
        I’ve been using your service for a while, and I would like to report an issue I’ve recently encountered.
        Please let me know by Friday, August 15th if you’d like to speak at the conference.
        It would be great to jump into a quick call tomorrow to discuss our collaboration.

        Thank you for help and feedback. Let’s keep in touch!
      </p>
